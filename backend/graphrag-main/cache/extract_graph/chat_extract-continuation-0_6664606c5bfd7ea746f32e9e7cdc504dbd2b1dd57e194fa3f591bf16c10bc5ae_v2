Identify all entities. For each identified entity, extract the following information:\n- entity_name: Name of the entity, capitalized\n- entity_type: One of the following types: [organization,person,geo,event]\n- entity_description: Comprehensive description of the entity's attributes and activities\nFormat each entity as (\"entity\"<|><entity_name><|><entity_type><|><entity_description>)\n \n2. From the entities identified in step 1, identify all pairs of (source_entity, target_entity) that are *clearly related* to each other.\nFor each pair of related entities, extract the following information:\n- source_entity: name of the source entity, as identified in step 1\n- target_entity: name of the target entity, as identified in step 1\n- relationship_description: explanation as to why you think the source entity and the target entity are related to each other\n- relationship_strength: a numeric score indicating strength of the relationship between the source entity and target entity\n Format each relationship as (\"relationship\"<|><source_entity><|><target_entity><|><relationship_description><|><relationship_strength>)\n \n3.

从5开始拿，选哪些数和5组合呢？优先拿已有的最小的，便是1，如果1不存在，再拿2，以此类推，直到5。\n记住每成功拿出一个，对应的cnt[]都要减1，以免重复拿。\n• 再从4开始拿，确定要拿4，优先拿已有的最小的，便是1，拿三个数就是411，拿两个数就是4和任一个大于1\n且小于5的数就行。\n• 再拿3，无非就是312,33,322，这里先拿33再拿322因为322加起来是7,312加起来是6，先拿最节省的组\n合。\n• 最后拿2，那只能222的组合了。\n• 优先顺序是 5+1->5+2->5+3->5+4->5+5->4+1+2-> 4+2->4+3->4+4->3+3-> 3+2+2->2+2+2\n\n\n8.二进制\n \n \nx = int(input())\nans =
