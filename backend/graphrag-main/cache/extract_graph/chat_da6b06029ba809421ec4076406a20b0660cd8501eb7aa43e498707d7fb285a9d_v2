It differs from WUnk in that\nthe latter uses no back-off dictionary, and just rep-\nresents out-of-vocabulary words as UNK12. The\nback-off dictionary improves unigram F1 for rare\nand unseen words, although the improvement is\nsmaller for English→Russian, since the back-off\ndictionary is incapable of transliterating names.\nAll subword systems operate without a back-off\ndictionary. We ﬁrst focus on unigram F1, where\nall systems improve over the baseline, especially\nfor rare words (36.8%→41.8% for EN→DE;\n26.5%→29.7% for EN→RU). For OOVs, the\nbaseline strategy of copying unknown words\nworks well for English→German. However, when\nalphabets differ, like in English→Russian, the\nsubword models do much better.\n12We use UNK for words that are outside the model vo-\ncabulary, and OOV for those that do not occur in the training\ntext.\nUnigram F1 scores indicate that learning the\nBPE symbols on the vocabulary union (BPE-\nJ90k) is more effective than learning them sep-\narately (BPE-60k), and more effective than using\ncharacter bigrams with a shortlist of 50 000 unseg-\nmented words (C2-50k), but all reported subword\nsegmentations are viable choices and outperform\nthe back-off dictionary baseline.\nOur subword representations cause big im-\nprovements in the translation of rare and unseen\nwords, but these only constitute 9-11% of the test\nsets.\nSince rare words tend to carry central in-\nformation in a sentence, we suspect that BLEU\nand CHRF3 underestimate their effect on transla-\ntion quality. Still, we also see improvements over\nthe baseline in total unigram F1, as well as BLEU\nand CHRF3, and the subword ensembles outper-\nform the WDict baseline by 0.3–1.3 BLEU and\n0.6–2 CHRF3. There is some inconsistency be-\ntween BLEU and CHRF3, which we attribute to the\nfact that BLEU has a precision bias, and CHRF3 a\nrecall bias.\nFor English→German, we observe the best\nBLEU score of 25.3 with C2-50k, but the best\nCHRF3 score of 54.1 with BPE-J90k. For com-\nparison to the (to our knowledge) best non-neural\nMT system on this data set, we report syntax-\nbased SMT results (Sennrich and Haddow, 2015).\nWe observe that our best systems outperform the\nsyntax-based system in terms of BLEU, but not\nin\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "gemma2-9b-it", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": null, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}}
