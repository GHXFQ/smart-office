This ex-\nample is still translated correctly, but we observe\nspurious insertions and deletions of characters in\nthe BPE-60k system. An example is the translit-\neration of rakﬁsk, where a п is inserted and a к\nis deleted.\nWe trace this error back to transla-\ntion pairs in the training data with inconsistent\nsegmentations, such as (p|rak|ri|ti→пра|крит|и\n\n\nsystem\nsentence\nsource\nhealth research institutes\nreference\nGesundheitsforschungsinstitute\nWDict\nForschungsinstitute\nC2-50k\nFo|rs|ch|un|gs|in|st|it|ut|io|ne|n\nBPE-60k\nGesundheits|forsch|ungsinstitu|ten\nBPE-J90k\nGesundheits|forsch|ungsin|stitute\nsource\nasinine situation\nreference\ndumme Situation\nWDict\nasinine situation → UNK → asinine\nC2-50k\nas|in|in|e situation → As|in|en|si|tu|at|io|n\nBPE-60k\nas|in|ine situation → A|in|line-|Situation\nBPE-J90K\nas|in|ine situation → As|in|in-|Situation\nTable 4: English→German translation example.\n“|” marks subword boundaries.\nsystem\nsentence\nsource\nMirzayeva\nreference\nМирзаева (Mirzaeva)\nWDict\nMirzayeva\n→ UNK → Mirzayeva\nC2-50k\nMi|rz|ay|ev|a → Ми|рз|ае|ва (Mi|rz|ae|va)\nBPE-60k\nMirz|ayeva\n→ Мир|за|ева (Mir|za|eva)\nBPE-J90k\nMir|za|yeva → Мир|за|ева (Mir|za|eva)\nsource\nrakﬁsk\nreference\nракфиска (rakﬁska)\nWDict\nrakﬁsk\n→ UNK → rakﬁsk\nC2-50k\nra|kf|is|k → ра|кф|ис|к (ra|kf|is|k)\nBPE-60k\nrak|f|isk → пра|ф|иск (pra|f|isk)\nBPE-J90k\nrak|f|isk → рак|ф|иска (rak|f|iska)\nTable 5: English→Russian translation examples.\n“|” marks subword boundaries.\n(pra|krit|i)), from which the translation (rak→пра)\nis erroneously learned.

In this work, our choice of vocabulary size\nis somewhat arbitrary, and mainly motivated by\ncomparison to prior work. One avenue of future\nresearch is to learn the optimal vocabulary size for\na translation task, which we expect to depend on\nthe language pair and amount of training data, au-\ntomatically. We also believe there is further po-\ntential in bilingually informed segmentation algo-\nrithms to create more alignable subword units, al-\nthough the segmentation algorithm cannot rely on\nthe target text at runtime.\nWhile the relative effectiveness will depend on\nlanguage-speciﬁc factors such as vocabulary size,\nwe believe that subword segmentations are suit-\nable for most language pairs, eliminating the need\nfor large NMT vocabularies or back-off models.\nAcknowledgments\nWe thank Maja Popovi\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "gemma2-9b-it", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": null, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}}
