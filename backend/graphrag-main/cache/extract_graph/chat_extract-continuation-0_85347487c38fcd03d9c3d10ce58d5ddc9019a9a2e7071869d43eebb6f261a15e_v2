In practice, we increase efﬁciency by\nindexing all pairs, and updating data structures in-\ncrementally.\nThe main difference to other compression al-\ngorithms, such as Huffman encoding, which have\nbeen proposed to produce a variable-length en-\ncoding of words for NMT (Chitnis and DeNero,\n2015), is that our symbol sequences are still in-\nterpretable as subword units, and that the network\ncan generalize to translate and produce new words\n(unseen at training time) on the basis of these sub-\nword units.\nFigure 1 shows a toy example of learned BPE\noperations. At test time, we ﬁrst split words into\nsequences of characters, then apply the learned op-\nerations to merge the characters into larger, known\nsymbols.\nThis is applicable to any word, and\nallows for open-vocabulary networks with ﬁxed\nsymbol vocabularies.3 In our example, the OOV\n‘lower’ would be segmented into ‘low er·’.\n3The only symbols that will be unknown at test time are\nunknown characters, or symbols of which all occurrences\nin the training text have been merged into larger symbols,\nlike ‘safeguar’, which has all occurrences in our training text\nmerged into ‘safeguard’. We observed no such symbols at\ntest time, but the issue could be easily solved by recursively\nreversing speciﬁc merges until all symbols are known.\nWe evaluate two methods of applying BPE:\nlearning two independent encodings, one for the\nsource, one for the target vocabulary, or learning\nthe encoding on the union of the two vocabular-\nies (which we call joint BPE).4 The former has the\nadvantage of being more compact in terms of text\nand vocabulary size, and having stronger guaran-\ntees that each subword unit has been seen in the\ntraining text of the respective language, whereas\nthe latter improves consistency between the source\nand the target segmentation. If we apply BPE in-\ndependently, the same name may be segmented\ndifferently in the two languages, which makes it\nharder for the neural models to learn a mapping\nbetween the subword units. To increase the con-\nsistency between English and Russian segmenta-\ntion despite the differing alphabets, we transliter-\nate the Russian vocabulary into Latin characters\nwith ISO-9 to learn the joint BPE encoding, then\ntransliterate the BPE merge operations back into\nCyrillic to apply them to the Russian training text.5\n4\nEvaluation\nWe aim to answer the following empirical ques-\ntions:\n• Can we improve the translation of rare and\nunseen words in neural machine translation\nby representing them via subword units?\n• Which segmentation into subword units per-\nforms best in terms of vocabulary size, text\nsize, and translation quality?\nWe perform experiments on data from the\nshared translation task of WMT 2015.\nFor\nEnglish→German, our training set consists of 4.2\nmillion sentence pairs, or approximately 100 mil-\nlion tokens. For English→Russian, the training set\nconsists of 2.6 million sentence pairs, or approx-\nimately 50 million tokens. We tokenize and true-\ncase the data with the scripts provided in Moses\n(Koehn et al., 2007). We use newstest2013 as de-\nvelopment set, and report results on newstest2014\nand newstest2015.\nWe report results with BLEU (mteval-v13a.pl),\nand CHRF3 (Popovi´c, 2015), a character n-gram\nF3 score which was found to correlate well with\n4In practice, we simply concatenate the source and target\nside of the training set to learn joint BPE.\n5Since the Russian training text also contains words that\nuse the Latin alphabet, we also apply the Latin BPE opera-\ntions.\n\n\nhuman judgments, especially for translations out\nof English (Stanojevi´c et al., 2015).\nSince our\nmain claim is concerned with the translation of\nrare and unseen words, we report separate statis-\ntics for these. We measure these through unigram\nF1, which we calculate as the harmonic mean of\nclipped unigram precision and recall.6\nWe perform all experiments with Groundhog7\n(Bahdanau et al., 2015). We generally follow set-\ntings by previous work (Bahdanau et al., 2015;\nJean et al., 2015).\nAll networks have a hidden\nlayer size of 1000, and an embedding layer size\nof 620.

We train a network for\napproximately 7 days, then take the last 4 saved\nmodels (models being saved every 12 hours), and\ncontinue training each with a ﬁxed embedding\nlayer (as suggested by (Jean et al., 2015)) for 12\nhours.
