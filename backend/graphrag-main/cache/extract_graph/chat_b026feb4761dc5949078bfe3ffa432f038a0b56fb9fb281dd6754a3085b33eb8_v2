We train a network for\napproximately 7 days, then take the last 4 saved\nmodels (models being saved every 12 hours), and\ncontinue training each with a ﬁxed embedding\nlayer (as suggested by (Jean et al., 2015)) for 12\nhours. We perform two independent training runs\nfor each models, once with cut-off for gradient\nclipping (Pascanu et al., 2013) of 5.0, once with\na cut-off of 1.0 – the latter produced better single\nmodels for most settings. We report results of the\nsystem that performed best on our development set\n(newstest2013), and of an ensemble of all 8 mod-\nels.\nWe use a beam size of 12 for beam search,\nwith probabilities normalized by sentence length.\nWe use a bilingual dictionary based on fast-align\n(Dyer et al., 2013). For our baseline, this serves\nas back-off dictionary for rare words. We also use\nthe dictionary to speed up translation for all ex-\nperiments, only performing the softmax over a ﬁl-\ntered list of candidate translations (like Jean et al.\n(2015), we use K = 30000; K′ = 10).\n4.1\nSubword statistics\nApart from translation quality, which we will ver-\nify empirically, our main objective is to represent\nan open vocabulary through a compact ﬁxed-size\nsubword vocabulary, and allow for efﬁcient train-\ning and decoding.8\nStatistics for different segmentations of the Ger-\n6Clipped unigram precision is essentially 1-gram BLEU\nwithout brevity penalty.\n7github.com/sebastien-j/LV_groundhog\n8The time complexity of encoder-decoder architectures is\nat least linear to sequence length, and oversplitting harms ef-\nﬁciency.\nman side of the parallel data are shown in Table\n1. A simple baseline is the segmentation of words\ninto character n-grams.9 Character n-grams allow\nfor different trade-offs between sequence length\n(# tokens) and vocabulary size (# types), depend-\ning on the choice of n. The increase in sequence\nlength is substantial; one way to reduce sequence\nlength is to leave a shortlist of the k most frequent\nword types unsegmented. Only the unigram repre-\nsentation is truly open-vocabulary. However, the\nunigram representation performed poorly in pre-\nliminary experiments, and we report translation re-\nsults with a bigram representation, which is empir-\nically better, but unable to produce some tokens in\nthe test set with the training set vocabulary.\nWe report statistics for several word segmenta-\ntion techniques that have proven useful in previous\nSMT research, including frequency-based com-\npound splitting (Koehn and Knight, 2003), rule-\nbased hyphenation (Liang, 1983), and Morfessor\n(Creutz and Lagus, 2002). We ﬁnd that they only\nmoderately reduce vocabulary size, and do not\nsolve the unknown word problem, and we thus ﬁnd\nthem unsuitable for our goal of open-vocabulary\ntranslation without back-off dictionary.\nBPE meets our goal of being open-vocabulary,\nand the learned merge operations can be applied\nto the test set to obtain a segmentation with no\nunknown symbols.10\nIts main difference from\nthe character-level model is that the more com-\npact representation of BPE allows for shorter se-\nquences, and that the attention model operates\non variable-length units.11\nTable 1 shows BPE\nwith 59 500 merge operations, and joint BPE with\n89 500 operations.\nIn practice, we did not include infrequent sub-\nword units in the NMT network vocabulary, since\nthere is noise in the subword symbol sets, e.g.\nbecause of characters from foreign alphabets.\nHence, our network vocabularies in Table 2 are\ntypically slightly smaller than the number of types\nin Table 1.\n9Our character n-grams do not cross word boundaries. We\nmark whether a subword is word-ﬁnal or not with a special\ncharacter, which allows us to restore the original tokenization.\n10Joint BPE can produce segments that are unknown be-\ncause they only occur in the English training text, but these\nare rare (0.05% of test tokens).\n11We highlighted the limitations of word-level attention in\nsection 3.1. At the other end of the spectrum, the character\nlevel is suboptimal for alignment (Tiedemann, 2009).\n\n\nvocabulary\nBLEU\nCHRF3\nunigram F1 (%)\nname\nsegmentation shortlist\nsource\ntarget single ens-8 single ens-8\nall\nrare OOV\nsyntax-based (Sennrich and Haddow, 2015)\n24.4\n-\n55.3\n- 59.1 46.0\n37.7\nWUnk\n-\n- 300 000 500 000\n20.6\n22.8\n47.2\n48.9 56.7 20.4\n0.0\nWDict\n-\n- 300 000 500 000\n22.0\n24.2\n50.5\n52.4 58.1 36.8\n36.8\nC2-50k\nchar-bigram\n50 000\n60 000\n60\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "gemma2-9b-it", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": null, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}}
