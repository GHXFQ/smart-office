For com-\nparison to the (to our knowledge) best non-neural\nMT system on this data set, we report syntax-\nbased SMT results (Sennrich and Haddow, 2015).\nWe observe that our best systems outperform the\nsyntax-based system in terms of BLEU, but not\nin terms of CHRF3. Regarding other neural sys-\ntems, Luong et al. (2015a) report a BLEU score of\n25.9 on newstest2015, but we note that they use an\nensemble of 8 independently trained models, and\nalso report strong improvements from applying\ndropout, which we did not use. We are conﬁdent\nthat our improvements to the translation of rare\nwords are orthogonal to improvements achievable\nthrough other improvements in the network archi-\n\n\ntecture, training algorithm, or better ensembles.\nFor English→Russian, the state of the art is\nthe phrase-based system by Haddow et al. (2015).\nIt outperforms our WDict baseline by 1.5 BLEU.\nThe subword models are a step towards closing\nthis gap, and BPE-J90k yields an improvement of\n1.3 BLEU, and 2.0 CHRF3, over WDict.\nAs a further comment on our translation results,\nwe want to emphasize that performance variabil-\nity is still an open problem with NMT. On our de-\nvelopment set, we observe differences of up to 1\nBLEU between different models. For single sys-\ntems, we report the results of the model that per-\nforms best on dev (out of 8), which has a stabi-\nlizing effect, but how to control for randomness\ndeserves further attention in future research.\n5\nAnalysis\n5.1\nUnigram accuracy\nOur main claims are that the translation of rare and\nunknown words is poor in word-level NMT mod-\nels, and that subword models improve the trans-\nlation of these word types. To further illustrate\nthe effect of different subword segmentations on\nthe translation of rare and unseen words, we plot\ntarget-side words sorted by their frequency in the\ntraining set.13 To analyze the effect of vocabulary\nsize, we also include the system C2-3/500k, which\nis a system with the same vocabulary size as the\nWDict baseline, and character bigrams to repre-\nsent unseen words.\nFigure 2 shows results for the English–German\nensemble systems on newstest2015.\nUnigram\nF1 of all systems tends to decrease for lower-\nfrequency words. The baseline system has a spike\nin F1 for OOVs, i.e. words that do not occur in\nthe training text. This is because a high propor-\ntion of OOVs are names, for which a copy from\nthe source to the target text is a good strategy for\nEnglish→German.\nThe systems with a target vocabulary of 500 000\nwords mostly differ in how well they translate\nwords with rank > 500 000. A back-off dictionary\nis an obvious improvement over producing UNK,\nbut the subword system C2-3/500k achieves better\nperformance. Note that all OOVs that the back-\noff dictionary produces are words that are copied\nfrom the source, usually names, while the subword\n13We perform binning of words with the same training set\nfrequency, and apply bezier smoothing to the graph.\nsystems can productively form new words such as\ncompounds.\nFor the 50 000 most frequent words, the repre-\nsentation is the same for all neural networks, and\nall neural networks achieve comparable unigram\nF1 for this category. For the interval between fre-\nquency rank 50 000 and 500 000, the comparison\nbetween C2-3/500k and C2-50k unveils an inter-\nesting difference. The two systems only differ in\nthe size of the shortlist, with C2-3/500k represent-\ning words in this interval as single units, and C2-\n50k via subword units. We ﬁnd that the perfor-\nmance of C2-3/500k degrades heavily up to fre-\nquency rank 500 000, at which point the model\nswitches to a subword representation and perfor-\nmance recovers. The performance of C2-50k re-\nmains more stable. We attribute this to the fact\nthat subword units are less sparse than words. In\nour training set, the frequency rank 50 000 corre-\nsponds to a frequency of 60 in the training data;\nthe frequency rank 500 000 to a frequency of 2.\nBecause subword representations are less sparse,\nreducing the size of the network vocabulary, and\nrepresenting more words via subword units, can\nlead to better performance.\nThe F1 numbers hide some qualitative differ-\nences between systems.\nFor English→German,\nWDict produces few OOVs (26.5% recall), but\nwith high precision (60.6%) , whereas the subword\nsystems achieve higher recall, but lower precision.\nWe note that the character bigram model C2-50k\nproduces the most OOV words, and achieves rel-\natively low precision of 29.1% for this category.\nHowever, it outperforms the back-off dictionary\nin recall (33.0%).
