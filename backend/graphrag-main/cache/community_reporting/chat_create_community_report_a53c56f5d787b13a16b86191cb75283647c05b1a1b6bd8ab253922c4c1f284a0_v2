It operates as a word-level model and incorporates a back-off dictionary to manage out-of-vocabulary (OOV) words, which are a common challenge in machine translation tasks. While WDICT has been referenced in translation examples and experiments, its performance for OOVs is noted to be suboptimal. However, the system shows improvement when integrated with subword models, which enhance its ability to process and translate words more effectively. Overall, WDICT serves as a foundational tool in translation research, providing a baseline for evaluating and advancing more sophisticated translation systems.\",6\r\n62,BPE-J90K,\"BPE-J90K is a neural machine translation system that employs joint byte pair encoding (BPE) for subword segmentation, specifically designed for English→Russian translation tasks. This system enhances translation performance by learning BPE symbols on the vocabulary union, which improves both precision and recall in translation tasks. BPE-J90K has demonstrated significant improvements in key evaluation metrics, including BLEU and CHRF3 scores, which are commonly used to assess the quality of machine translation outputs. The system's joint BPE encoding approach allows it to effectively segment subwords, contributing to more accurate and fluent translations. As discussed in research, BPE-J90K represents an advanced subword segmentation technique that optimizes the neural machine translation process, making it a valuable tool for improving translation quality in bilingual contexts.\",5\r\n63,BPE-60K,\"BPE-60K is a subword segmentation technique primarily utilized in English-to-Russian translation tasks. It employs Byte Pair Encoding (BPE) to break down words into smaller, manageable subword units, which aids in handling out-of-vocabulary words and improving translation efficiency. However, BPE-60K has been noted to suffer from transliteration errors, particularly in the context of English-to-Russian translation. These errors arise due to segmentation inconsistencies, where the system fails to consistently and accurately segment words into subword units, leading to inaccuracies in transliteration. \n\nDespite these challenges, BPE-60K remains a significant method in the field of machine translation, as it learns BPE symbols separately, allowing for a more tailored approach to subword segmentation. This separate learning process enables the system to better adapt to the specific linguistic characteristics of the languages involved, though it does not entirely eliminate the issues related to segmentation inconsistencies. Overall, BPE-60K represents a valuable yet imperfect tool in the domain of subword segmentation and machine translation.\",5\r\n64,C2-50K,\"C2-50K is a subword segmentation system designed for neural machine translation (NMT), specifically tailored to improve the handling of rare and unknown words during translation tasks. It employs a character bigram model, which segments text into subword units based on character-level patterns, enhancing its ability to process out-of-vocabulary (OOV) words. The system is particularly noted for its application in English→Russian translation, where it has been observed to produce a higher number of OOV words compared to other models. While this approach aids in translating infrequent terms, it has been associated with relatively low precision in certain contexts, potentially due to the increased complexity introduced by the subword segmentation process. \n\nC2-50K utilizes a predefined shortlist of 50,000 unsegmented words, which helps balance the granularity of segmentation with computational efficiency. This technique is rooted in the broader research on subword units in NMT, where such methods are recognized for their ability to bridge the gap between word-level and character-level representations. By focusing on character bigrams, C2-50K strikes a balance between capturing fine-grained linguistic patterns and maintaining manageable model complexity. Overall, C2-50K represents a specialized approach within the field of neural machine translation, emphasizing the importance of subword segmentation in addressing the challenges posed by rare and unknown words, albeit with some trade-offs in precision.\",6\r\n69,C2-3/500K,A neural machine translation system with a large vocabulary size and character bigrams for representing unseen words,1\r\n\n\n-----Relationships-----\nhuman_readable_id,source,target,description,combined_degree\r\n46,WDICT,BPE-J90K,WDict is a baseline model compared to BPE-J90k in translation experiments,11\r\n51,BPE-60K,C2-50K,BPE-60k and C2-50k are both subword segmentation techniques used in translation experiments,11\r\n59,C2-50K,BPE-J90K,Both systems are neural machine translation models that use subword segmentation techniques to improve translation performance,11\r\n49,BPE-J90K,BPE-60K,BPE-J90k and BPE-60k are both subword segmentation techniques used in translation experiments,10\r\n61,C2-50K,C2-3/500K,\"Both systems use subword representations, but C2-3/500K has a larger vocabulary size and switches to subword units at a higher frequency rank\",7\r\n\n\nThe report should include the following sections:\n\n- TITLE: community's name that represents its key entities - title should be short but specific.
