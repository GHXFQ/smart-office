It operates as a word-level model and incorporates a back-off dictionary to manage out-of-vocabulary (OOV) words, which are a common challenge in machine translation tasks. While WDICT has been referenced in translation examples and experiments, its performance for OOVs is noted to be suboptimal. However, the system shows improvement when integrated with subword models, which enhance its ability to process and translate words more effectively. Overall, WDICT serves as a foundational tool in translation research, providing a baseline for evaluating and advancing more sophisticated translation systems.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1749700679, "model": "deepseek-chat", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": null, "usage": {"completion_tokens": 136, "prompt_tokens": 221, "total_tokens": 357, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
