Their work has been instrumental in advancing the understanding and application of language models in computational linguistics. In 2012, MIKOLOV ET AL. conducted pioneering research on subword language models, proposing innovative approaches that incorporated the use of syllables. This research marked a notable shift in how language models could be structured, offering more granular and efficient methods for processing and understanding text. Their contributions have had a lasting impact on the field, influencing subsequent developments in NLP and machine learning. Overall, MIKOLOV ET AL. are recognized for their dual focus on both neural network language models and subword-level modeling, solidifying their legacy as key figures in the evolution of language modeling techniques.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1749700680, "model": "deepseek-chat", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": null, "usage": {"completion_tokens": 175, "prompt_tokens": 182, "total_tokens": 357, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
