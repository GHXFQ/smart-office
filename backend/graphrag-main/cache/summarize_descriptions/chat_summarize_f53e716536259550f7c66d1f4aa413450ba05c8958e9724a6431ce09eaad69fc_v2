This system enhances translation performance by learning BPE symbols on the vocabulary union, which improves both precision and recall in translation tasks. BPE-J90K has demonstrated significant improvements in key evaluation metrics, including BLEU and CHRF3 scores, which are commonly used to assess the quality of machine translation outputs. The system's joint BPE encoding approach allows it to effectively segment subwords, contributing to more accurate and fluent translations. As discussed in research, BPE-J90K represents an advanced subword segmentation technique that optimizes the neural machine translation process, making it a valuable tool for improving translation quality in bilingual contexts.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1749700681, "model": "deepseek-chat", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": null, "usage": {"completion_tokens": 160, "prompt_tokens": 243, "total_tokens": 403, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
